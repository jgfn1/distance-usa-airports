Here's the evaluation prompt to share with your dev candidates:
Build a web app using React and deploy it on www.netlify.com, using their free package.
This app should calculate the distance between two United States airports in nautical
miles, using auto-complete for the airport fields. All United States Airports should 
be searchable by name or 3 digit code. 

Bonus: plot the route on Google maps. 
Note: please choose the API you think best fits your solution. Once completed,
please send us the Netlify URL of the app and a zip of the source code.

You will be evaluated based on:
* The structure of your React components, HTML and CSS structure
* Use of Material UI components
* The cleanliness (or whatever else you care about) of your visual design
* Appropriate use of TypeScript
* Being mobile friendly
